# Image Upload Implementation Summary

## Overview
The image upload functionality has been successfully implemented to match the backend API. This includes both a standalone upload component and integration with the markdown editor.

## Backend Implementation (Already Existed)
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/media/upload`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token required
- **File validation**: 10MB size limit, supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`
- **Image processing**: Automatic resizing to multiple sizes (300px, 600px, 1200px width)
- **Storage**: Files stored in `/content/media/YYYY-MM/` directory structure
- **Metadata**: JSON metadata stored separately for each file

## Frontend Implementation (Newly Added)

### 1. Type Definitions (`/frontend/src/types/media.ts`)
```typescript
export interface MediaFile {
  id: string;
  fileName: string;
  filePath: string;
  contentType: string;
  fileSize: number;
  uploadedBy: string;
  uploadedDate: string;
  type: MediaType;
  imageMetadata?: ImageMetadata;
}

export enum MediaType {
  Image = 0,
  Document = 1,
  Other = 2
}
```

### 2. API Functions (`/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)
- `uploadFile(file: File, authToken: string): Promise<MediaFile>` - Upload a file
- `getMediaFiles(authToken: string): Promise<MediaFile[]>` - Get all media files
- `deleteMediaFile(fileId: string, authToken: string): Promise<void>` - Delete a file

### 3. Image Upload Component (`/frontend/src/components/image-upload.tsx`)
Features:
- **File Upload**: Drag & drop or browse to select files
- **Media Library**: Browse previously uploaded files
- **File Management**: Delete, copy URL, download files
- **Image Preview**: Thumbnail previews for image files
- **Type Filtering**: Filter by images or documents
- **File Information**: Shows file size, upload date, dimensions

### 4. Markdown Editor Integration (`/frontend/src/components/markdown-preview.tsx`)
- Added image upload button to the markdown toolbar
- Opens image upload dialog when clicked
- Automatically inserts markdown image syntax: `![Image](url)`
- Supports both upload and selection from media library

### 5. Admin Media Management (`/frontend/src/app/admin/media/page.tsx`)
- Dedicated media management page for admins
- Grid view of all uploaded media
- Search and filter functionality
- Bulk operations support
- File information display

### 6. Admin Panel Integration (`/frontend/src/app/admin/page.tsx`)
- Added "Media" tab to admin panel
- Link to dedicated media management page
- Overview of media functionality

## File Upload Flow

1. **User uploads file** via the ImageUpload component
2. **Frontend sends** multipart/form-data to `/api/media/upload`
3. **Backend validates** file size, type, and authentication
4. **Backend processes** images (creates resized versions)
5. **Backend stores** file in directory structure and metadata in JSON
6. **Backend returns** MediaFile object with file information
7. **Frontend updates** UI with new file in media library

## File Access

- **Direct file access**: `http://localhost:5141/media/{filePath}`
- **Resized images**: Automatically generated for different sizes
- **Metadata access**: `GET /api/media/{fileId}` for file information

## Security Features

- **Authentication required** for all upload/delete operations
- **File type validation** on both frontend and backend
- **File size limits** (10MB maximum)
- **User-based access control** (users can only see their own files, admins see all)

## Integration Points

### Post Creation/Editing
- Markdown editor includes image upload button
- Users can upload images directly while writing posts
- Images are automatically inserted into markdown content

### Media Library
- Centralized location for all uploaded media
- Accessible from both post editor and admin panel
- Supports search and filtering

### Admin Management
- Admins can view all uploaded media
- Can delete files uploaded by any user
- Media statistics and management tools

## Usage Examples

### In Post Editor
1. Click the image icon in the markdown toolbar
2. Upload new image or select from library
3. Image URL is automatically inserted into markdown
4. Preview shows rendered image

### In Admin Panel
1. Navigate to Admin → Media tab
2. View all uploaded media files
3. Search, filter, and manage files
4. Upload new files or delete existing ones

## Technical Details

### File Storage Structure
```
/content/media/
├── 2024-01/
│   ├── {uuid}.jpg
│   ├── {uuid}-300w.jpg
│   ├── {uuid}-600w.jpg
│   └── {uuid}-1200w.jpg
└── metadata/
    └── {uuid}.json
```

### API Endpoints Used
- `POST /api/media/upload` - Upload file
- `GET /api/media` - List media files
- `GET /api/media/{fileId}` - Get file info
- `DELETE /api/media/{fileId}` - Delete file
- `GET /media/{filePath}` - Serve file content

## Testing

Both frontend and backend servers are running:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5141

The implementation is ready for testing and use.
