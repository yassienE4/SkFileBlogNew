Let me confess something:  
I used to *hate* cooking.

To me, it was messy, time-consuming, and just another chore standing between me and food. Why would I spend an hour preparing something I could microwave in three minutes?

But over the past year, something changed.

Cooking became... *calming*. Even *fun*. It turned into a daily ritual I look forward to — and I’m not a chef, a food blogger, or someone with fancy knives and 47 kinds of salt.

I’m just a regular person who went from hating cooking to *loving* it.

Here’s how it happened — and how you can start enjoying cooking too (even if you’re currently surviving on toast and instant noodles).

## 1. **I Stopped Aiming for Perfection**

This was huge.

Early on, I thought every meal had to look like a Gordon Ramsay dish or go viral on TikTok. If it didn’t, I felt like a failure.

That mindset? *Toxic*.

Once I let go of perfection and focused on *progress*, everything shifted.

- Burnt the onions? No big deal.  
- Chicken a little dry? Still edible.  
- Pasta sauce too watery? Add bread. Boom — rustic Italian.

### 🧠 Mindset shift:
> “Done is better than perfect. And edible is still a win.”

## 2. **I Learned 3 Signature Dishes**

Instead of trying something new every day (and getting overwhelmed), I picked **three simple meals** and made them over and over.

Mine were:
- Garlic butter pasta with veggies  
- Chicken stir fry with rice  
- One-pan roasted potatoes + protein

Each dish taught me a *set of skills*:
- Timing different ingredients  
- Seasoning properly  
- Not crowding the pan (IYKYK)

After a few weeks, I could cook all three from muscle memory — no recipe needed.

Suddenly, cooking was *relaxing*.

## 3. **I Created a “No-Think” Pantry**

Ever come home starving, open your fridge, and go:  
> “I have nothing to cook.”  
Even though you spent $70 on groceries?

That’s because you’re missing **core ingredients** — the ones that make cooking *easy*.

Here’s what I always keep stocked:

- **Carbs:** pasta, rice, tortillas, potatoes  
- **Proteins:** eggs, canned beans, frozen chicken  
- **Vegetables:** onions, garlic, frozen peas/corn, cherry tomatoes  
- **Flavor bombs:** soy sauce, chili flakes, lemon, mustard, parmesan, herbs  

With those? I can whip up 90% of meals in 20 minutes.

Try it — build your own “capsule pantry.” It’ll save your sanity.

## 4. **I Made It a Vibe**

Cooking doesn't have to feel like a task.  
Make it a *ritual*.

### Here’s my routine:
- Put on music or a podcast 🎶  
- Pour a drink (tea, wine, whatever) 🧃  
- Wear comfy clothes or an apron 😌  
- Light a candle 🕯️ (optional, but cozy)  
- Start chopping slowly — like I’m in a Studio Ghibli movie 🍲

By turning cooking into a *sensory experience*, it became something I *look forward to* — not something I dread.

## 5. **I Stopped Following Recipes Word-for-Word**

At first, I clung to recipes like a lifeline:
- 1 tsp cumin? *Must measure.*  
- Cook for 9 minutes? *Not a second longer.*  
- Missing one ingredient? *Can’t make the dish.* 😩

Eventually, I realized recipes are **guidelines**, not rules.

Now I:
- Swap ingredients freely  
- Taste constantly  
- Add spices by instinct  
- Use recipes for *inspiration*, not instruction

> Cooking became less like coding, more like jazz.

And honestly? That’s when it became fun.

## Final Thoughts: Cooking Is a Life Skill — and a Love Letter 🍽️

We live in a world obsessed with speed and convenience.  
But cooking slows you down. It reminds you to:
- Use your hands  
- Taste as you go  
- Feed yourself with intention

You don’t need to be a chef. You don’t need fancy gadgets.  
You just need a little patience, a few good ingredients, and the willingness to mess up (and eat your mistakes).

Start simple. Cook messy. And most of all — *have fun*.
